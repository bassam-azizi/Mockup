# Bassam-Azizi_Portfolio :

    - To build a portfolio in a clean HTML5 and CSS3 was Udacity's first project in the front-end web development nano degree program.
    - After taking a well structured fundemental courses through massive lectures and quizes, You're given a mockup design portfolio in pdf and you're asked to turn that to an alive website that is responsive and mobile-friendly just in clean html5 and css3.
    - As a student, I must say that this was a great experience, It changed the way i look web interfaces..
    - This was a clean HTML and CSS3, I used flex-box, media query, srcset..
    - The images was imported from Unsplash.com by the way.
    - i was using GraphicMagick to resize the images for the srcset..
    - Thank you.
